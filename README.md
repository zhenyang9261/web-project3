# Travelogue

## About this app

Travelogue is an full stack web application that allows users to relive some of their greatest adventures by allowing them to tell the stories behind some of their fondest (and maybe not so fond) memories and also share with other travel lovers.  Once an account is created, they can create journal entries telling where and when they went, a note to share their experience, a rating from 1-5 to indicate how fond they are of the travel, and whether they choose to publish this journal to share with other people. Please see the demo video below for all available features.
